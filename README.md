# Memory Profiler Application

This project demonstrates how you can create a dashboard using FastAPI as a backend, HTMX / TailwindCSS for frontend, and Plotly for the graphs. This dashboard runs a memory profile on a specified directory of your computer and show stats such as top memory usage files and which file extensions are using the most memory.
